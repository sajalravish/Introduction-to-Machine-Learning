How to reproduce my results:
1. Ensure that you have downloaded all necessary libraries (numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and pandas)
2. Navigate to your terminal. First cd into the "scripts" folder. Then, run "python gaussian_classifiers.py" or "python3 gaussian_classifier.py"
   to run my code for problem 8. You can also run "python plot_isocontours.py" or "python3 plot_isocontours.py" to run my code for problem 6
   or run "python gaussian_cov_matrix.py" or "python3 gaussian_cov_matrix.py" to run my code for problem 7.
3. I used the random seed np.random.seed(42) across all problems that required a random seed.
