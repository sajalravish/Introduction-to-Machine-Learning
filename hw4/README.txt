How to reproduce my results:
1. Ensure that you have downloaded all necessary libraries (numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and pandas).
2. Navigate to your terminal. Run "python scripts.py" or "python3 scripts.py"
   to run my code for problem 3. You can also run "python isocontours.py" or "python3 isocontours.py"
   to run my code for problem 5.
3. I used the random seed np.random.seed(189) across all problems that required a random seed.
