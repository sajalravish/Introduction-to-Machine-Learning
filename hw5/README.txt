How to reproduce my results:
1. Ensure that you have downloaded all necessary libraries (numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and pandas).
2. Navigate to your terminal. Run "python decision_tree_starter.py" or "python3 decision_tree_starter.py"
   to run my code for problem 4.
3. To run my code for the titanic dataset, make sure line 292 of decision_tree_starter.py is NOT commented out
   AND comment out line 293.
4. To run my code for the spam dataset, make sure line 293 of decision_tree_starter.py is NOT commented out
   AND comment out line 292.
5. I used the random seed np.random.seed(246810) across all problems that required a random seed.
